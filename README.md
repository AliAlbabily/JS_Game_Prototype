# About the project
I worked on this game prototype in 2019 where I did everything from scratch except for the resources that I imported within the project. The idea was not only to combine my creativity with my skills as a developer, but also to create a game-engine that would let me do basic stuff like switching between levels, character interaction etc. Feel free to take a closer look at the project by visiting the link under the section "Demo".
